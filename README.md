# User Experience (UX)
The goal of the First Aid for Kids website is to create a user-friendly platform where parents and educators can access essential first aid courses tailored for different age groups: Year 3, Year 4, and Years 5 & 6. Each course is designed to help children understand and apply basic first aid skills, empowering them to respond effectively in emergency situations.
The website provides detailed information about each course, helping parents and educators choose the right program for their children or students. 

**Responsiveness:** The website is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across different devices, including tablets and smartphones.

## Project Goals: 
### Agile Methodology
This project was created using Agile principles, with a project board on GitHub to manage tasks effectively. The board allowed me to track features in different stages, from to do tasks, in-progress and done.

For user stories, I used a standardized template as the foundation, ensuring consistency in their creation. 
Each user story has the following format:

"As a (role), I can (capability) so that (received benefit)."

Each user story included "Acceptance Criteria" to ensure tasks were completed and helped me in organizing and prioritizing the workflow.

### MoSCoW Prioritization
I utilized the MoSCoW Prioritization method for this project, categorizing tasks into:

**Must Haves:**  Essential components critical for the project.
**Should Haves:**  Valuable features, but not crucial for the MVP; these are prioritized after Must Haves.
**Could Haves:** Additional features that would enhance the project, but only if time permits after addressing higher-priority tasks.

The review page was classified as a "Should Have" feature. Due to time constraints, it was not implemented and remains on my to-do list.
