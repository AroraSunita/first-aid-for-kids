# Purpose and Target Audience

**Problem Statement:**
Many children lack basic first aid knowledge, which is essential for handling minor injuries and emergencies. Without this knowledge, children may not know how to respond in critical situations, leading to unnecessary panic or worsening of injuries.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of the "First Aid for Kids" project is to equip children with essential first aid skills tailored to their age group. The program aims to educate kids on how to respond effectively to common injuries and emergencies, empowering them to act confidently and safely in various situations. The courses are designed to be engaging and accessible, ensuring that children can easily grasp and apply these life-saving skills.

**Target Audience:** 
The target audience for this project includes children in primary school, specifically those in Year 3, Year 4, and Years 5 & 6. The program is also intended for parents, educators, and schools who are interested in providing their children and students with crucial first aid knowledge and skills.

# User Experience (UX)
The goal of the First Aid for Kids website is to create a user-friendly platform where parents and educators can access essential first aid courses tailored for different age groups: Year 3, Year 4, and Years 5 & 6. Each course is designed to help children understand and apply basic first aid skills, empowering them to respond effectively in emergency situations.
The website provides detailed information about each course, helping parents and educators choose the right program for their children or students. 

**Responsiveness:** The website is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across different devices, including tablets and smartphones.

## Project Goals: 
### Agile Methodology
This project was created using Agile principles, with a project board on GitHub to manage tasks effectively. The board allowed me to track features in different stages, from to do tasks, in-progress and done.

For user stories, I used a standardized template as the foundation, ensuring consistency in their creation. 
Each user story has the following format:

"As a (role), I can (capability) so that (received benefit)."

Each user story included "Acceptance Criteria" to ensure tasks were completed and helped me in organizing and prioritizing the workflow.

### MoSCoW Prioritization
I utilized the MoSCoW Prioritization method for this project, categorizing tasks into:

**Must Haves:**  Essential components critical for the project.
**Should Haves:**  Valuable features, but not crucial for the MVP; these are prioritized after Must Haves.
**Could Haves:** Additional features that would enhance the project, but only if time permits after addressing higher-priority tasks.

The review page was categorized as a "Should Have" feature. Due to time constraints, it was not implemented in the current version but is planned as a future feature.

### Future Features
1. Review system that allows visitors to read previous users' experiences. By sharing personal insights and feedback, potential visitors will gain a clearer understanding of the course content, quality, and overall experience. This will help them make more informed decisions before booking. 
2. Feedback forms to gather insights from users after a course been given to the children. These forms will allow users to share their thoughts on what worked well and what could be improved. The feedback collected will help refine the course content and delivery, ensuring a better experience for future participants. It also gives participants a voice, making them feel valued and engaged in the ongoing improvement of the course.
3. Different registrations provide multiple registration options tailored to different groups, such as schools, parents, private institutes, or organizations. 
4. Quizes by incorporating a gamified element, quizzes enhance motivation and make the website more appealing and user-friendly.
5. Course materials and photos/videos, offer detailed course materials paired with high-quality photos and videos.

### Database Diagrams (ERD) & CRUD 
I used Canva to create ERDs, which helped me visualize and understand the relationships between tables in the PostgreSQL database.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd567af4-81b3-47b5-b76d-2da66a05ce9d)
